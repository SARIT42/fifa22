# fifa22
EDA, Prediction and Feature Analysis of the FIFA 22 male players dataset. Fun project combining the 3 things I love: Football, Data Science, XGBoost. In that order  :) 


NOTE:
GitHub doesn't allow/show interactive plots made using plotly library. Therefore screenshots of some of those plots created in the notebook has been added to the ***plots&results*** section, but ofcourse they are not interactive. To view the full notebook with all the interactive plots do visit:

Cheers :)
